# 👋 Hi, I’m Zahrah

I’m a BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Cybersecurity student, currently building my skills through small projects and hands-on learning.

### 🔧 What I’m working on:
- Strengthening my Python and Java fundamentals
- Exploring front-end development with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
- Learning how real-world systems are built and secured

## 🌱 This GitHub is a work in progress. I'm going to add more to this soon as of December 2025
